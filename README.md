# 🏠 Luxury Housing Sales Analysis – Bengaluru

## 📌 Project Overview
This project replicates a **real-world data analytics pipeline** for the **luxury real estate market in Bengaluru**.  
It demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data cleaning (Python), data warehousing (SQL), and interactive dashboarding (Power BI)**.

Dataset Size: **100,000+ records**  
Domain: **Real Estate | Business Intelligence | Data Analytics**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw housing dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- Load refined dataset into a SQL database.
- Build Power BI dashboards connected directly to SQL.
- Derive business insights for **market intelligence, pricing, buyer persona, and sales optimization**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy)
- **SQL** (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- **Power BI** (Live SQL connection, DAX calculations, KPIs)
- **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub** (Version Control)

---

## 📊 Business Use Cases
1. **Market Intelligence** → Locality & builder performance.
2. **Sales Optimization** → Booking drop-off analysis.
3. **Buyer Persona** → Sentiment analysis from buyer comments.
4. **Competitive Pricing** → Ticket size benchmarking across builders.
5. **Amenity Impact** → Correlation between amenities & booking success.
6. **Quarterly Tracking** → Trends for investment decisions.
